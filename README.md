## Ideas

Pull requests welcome. Here are some ideas:

* Randomly choose different Google fonts.
* When the baby presses non-alphanumeric keys, show shapes instead.
* Make sounds (tones) when the baby presses letters.
* When the baby presses a letter, randomly query Flickr for a photo of a word starting with that letter (like a random Apple).
* Find a way to disable the Mac function key actions.

Also, we should make an executable, ay?
